# About the project:
dApp focuses on allowing a user to save the password for later retrieval exclusively for him, not accessible to others.

Password is allowed to be changed at any time.

# Doubts of the project

1. Is the Smart Contracts supposed to allow multiple users to store their password under the same rules? Or is a single contract per user?

# Attack Vectors:

1. **Public Data:** As in blockchain all values saved in storage are accessible, the way the password is being stored is making it "retrievable" to any other user that want to get it.
   - **Recommended Solutions**:
     - **Encryption:** Make a mechanism of encryption/decryption of the password so that when people get the password from the storage, they do not have the data needed in order to decrypt it.
